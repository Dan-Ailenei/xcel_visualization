TODO:
    
    validate that the file is xlsx or xls
    validate if you found all the cells in the xcel file
    better visualization of the result
    make sure decimals don't produce errors
    find origin in a more flexible way
    better stop condition when you iterate over cells
    validation in form (names of cells must not be equal and formulas should be supported by xcel)
